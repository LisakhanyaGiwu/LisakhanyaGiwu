## Featured Projects 💻

### [Smart Bin Level Detection]

Smart Bin is a microcontroller-based project using ultrasonic sensors to detect bin levels. It aims to improve waste management by notifying when the bin is full. Built using Arduino/ESP, it demonstrates my skills in embedded systems, sensor integration, and practical electronics.
